//struct=container for variables, can have functions, and behaviors
//the View sfter contentview, is saying that this struct is going to 'behaves' like a view
//a view is just a rectangle area on screen
// emojis are just texts
// RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10.0) all arguments are labled, then there is the value
// zstack() : a struct that behaves just like a view
// roundeded rectangle also behaves like a shape
// strokes return a view, and if it didnt we couldnt put it in the zstack
// if you were to call the foreground function at the end of the zstack, it would make
// all of the content in the zstack return with an orange foreground
// zstack is essentially setting the enviroment for this view
//if you put the font on the zstack, it would make all of the fonts in that enviroment, have
// a large font
// for each is just going to iterate over a view
//index is the iteration ariable
//hstack is going to allow you to iterate over a view and stack those things horizontally
//..that is what the h stands for
